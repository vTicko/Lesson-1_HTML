### Elements & Tags

Elements on HTML pages are content wrapped within opening and closing tags:
`<p>`, is an open tag, with "`p`" as a keyword - can be thought as the content. Closing tags are written like `</p>`.

Some elements do not have closing a closing tag. These include:

`<br /> or <img/>`


## Creating an HTML File

Note, naming the file that contains the homepage of the website should be named Ã¬ndex.html`. This is because web servers by default will look for this naming convention.


### The DOCTYPE

Every HTML page begin with a doctype declaration. It tells the browser the version of HTML it should use to render the document. The doctype for the latest version of HTML (HTML5) is 
<center> 
`<!DOCTYPE html>`
</center>
