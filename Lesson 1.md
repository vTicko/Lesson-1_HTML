Elements on HTML pages are content wrapped within opening and closing tags:
`<p>`, is an open tag, with "`p`" as a keyword - can be thought as the content. Closing tags are written like `</p>`.

Some elements do not have closing a closing tag. These include:

`<br /> or <img/>`

Note, naming the file that contains the homepage of the website should be named ìndex.html`. This is because web servers by default will look for this naming convention.

`<!DOCTYPE html>`
